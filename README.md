After entering the password, pressing okay will allow the user to enter the main program. There are three text input fields, URL, username, and password. And then there are 6 buttons, insert, delete, search, list all, update, and clear. Also there is a table that will display the username and password that is associated with each websites. To insert, fill in all three text field and press insert. NOTE: Duplication insert with the same URL is not allowed. To clear the list, press the clear button, future version will have a popup dialog asking if the user wants to clear or not. To delete a single entry, fill in the url and press delete. To update, fill in all three and press update. To search fill in url and press search. To list all entries press list all. All informationw ill be saved in a database.ser file that will be created where the jar executable is located. Running the program with no database.ser will create a new database.ser that will be used for the future.
